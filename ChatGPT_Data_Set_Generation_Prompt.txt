You are a helpful assistant used to generate data for datasets.

The data set columns are "ID", "Excerpt", "SY1", "SY2", "CO1", "CO2", and "LQ Code".

Here are some definition of some key terms that will be important in analyzing the data set that you generate.

symbol: A Symbol (represented as SY) is a Noun or set of nouns acting as a substantial representation of the concept meant. The symbol stands for and represents the concept.;
concept: A Concept (represented as CO) is a Noun or set of nouns introducing new intrinsic or mutual properties."
incompleteness: "Incomplete (represented as INC) means that after having described a concept, no symbol is introduced or determined to refer to this concept.;
meaninglessness: Meaninglessness (represented as MLN) means that after having used a symbol, no definition of the symbol is given and the subsequent utterances make clear that the corresponding concept is missing or unclear.;
redundancy: Redundancy (represented as RDC) means that after having used a symbol for the reference of a concept, a different symbol is used for the reference of the same concept.;
ambiguity: Ambiguity (represented as AMB) means that after having used a symbol for the reference of a concept, a different concept can be detected, which is represented by the same symbol.;


For Context, the dataset represents requirements engineering excerpts and their corresponding Language Construct (LC) and Language Quality (LQ) codings, as described by a research paper titled 'Language quality in requirements development: tracing communication in the process of information systems development'. Language Construct (LC) represents the linguistic construction of a symbol-concept relationship that can be observed during the language development process. LC Codings may contain concepts (CO) and symbols (SY). Refer to the definition of concept and symbols that was provided earlier. The LC Codings are represented by the 'SY1, SY2, CO1, and CO2' columns in the dataset. If the generated data does not have 2 symbols and 2 concepts, leave the entry empty. The dataset contains 4 types of language quality issues: incompleteness (INC), meaningless (MLN), redundancy (RDC), and ambiguity (AMB). For the generated data, ensure the Language Quality (LQ Code) is 'redundancy'. Refer to the defintion of dredundancy that was provided earlier. Ensure each generated Excerpt is unique.

Generate a dataset as a table, which was definied earlier on in this prompt. The Except column of the dataset represents each unique requirement that can be identified from the reading. The wording of the except should be the exactly same as it is in the reading. The ID column just numbers each except therefore if the reading identifies 28 requirements, then the dataset should include 28 seperate and unique excepts and the ID should be labeled from 1 to 28.

The dataset should be shown in a table. The columns should be"ID", "Excerpt", "SY1", "SY2", "CO1", "CO2", and "LQ Code".

Again, the symbol needs to match the following defintion: A Symbol (represented as SY) is a Noun or set of nouns acting as a substantial representation of the concept meant. The symbol stands for and represents the concept. 

Also, "SY1", "SY2", "CO1", "CO2" should be unique from each other.

If a symbol is missing or a concept is missing, represent it with NULL.

Again, for the LQ coding sections, there are 4 LQ code options: incompleteness, meaninglessness, redundancy, and ambiguity.

Different excepts can potentially have different LQ code. You have to analyze the except and based on the definition of the different types of LQ codes, choose the one that best fits the except.

You need to generate the complete dataset. Generate a dataset with 100 IDs.

Here is an example dataset (in .csv) for reference:
id,Excerpt,SYM 2,SYM 2,CO1,CO2,LQ Code
,The system shall manage user data effectively., user data ,,NULL,,MLN
,The system shall facilitate the process by which customers engage in transactions.,NULL,,process by which customers engage in transactions.,,INC
,user transaction data relates to datat generated by user transactions; user transaction data has very large volume,User transaction data,User transaction data,geneerated by user transactions,has very large volume ,AMB
,These are a special category of [users]. The special castegory has rprivilages ,Null,Null,are a special category ,are a special category,RDC

In the CSV, each cell is separated by a comma therefore a line on the csv with 6 comma means that there will be 7 cells of data since the last cell value does not need to be followed with a comma.
