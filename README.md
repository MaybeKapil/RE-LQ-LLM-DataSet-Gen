# Data Set Generation Using ChatGPT:

## Guide on how we got ChatGPT to give us a dataset:

We engineered a prompt to get ChatGPT to output a dataset. We gave a single prompt to ChatGPT which included 1 example dataset and it outputted a new dataset.

## Features of the prompt:
First the prompt identifies the task that ChatGPT will be performing.
Then it (the prompt) identifies key terms relevant to the dataset such as ID, Except, SY1, SY2, CO1, CO2, and the different LQ codes.
Then it asks for the dataset to be generated in a table format and identifies what the coloums should be.
Then it goes back to expanding on how symbols should be definied and how LQ codes should be assigned. This bit of repetition was added to get better symbol definition and better LQ codes assignment. Previously, it was assigning symbols whose wording was not 100% consistent with the excerpt and all the LQ codes were the same.
Then it asks to generate a complete dataset with 100 IDs. This is to ensure a large dataset and prevent ChatGPT from giving a sample dataset consisting of only a few IDs.
For hopes of impoved dataset generation and requirement classification, the sample LCLQ that you had provided us was included in the prompt as CSV text so that ChatGPT could reference that.
By giving ChatGPT the engineered prompt, it should output a table. You can request the table to be converted into .csv (comma delimited text) format so that you can copy it into a text file, save it as a .csv file, and then import it into excel.
If ChatGPT doesn't print the complete table, just say "continue" and it will generate the rest of the table.
For the sake of have a good size dataset, the prompt specifies for the generation of a dataset with 100 IDs.
